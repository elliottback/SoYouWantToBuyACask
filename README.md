# Crowdfunding / Shared Cask Options

Buying and warehousing an entire cask is not necessarily an easy undertaking, and every cask has its share of risk of being a dud.  Logistically, it might make more sense to buy individual bottle shares in casks of interest; several companies have begun to do this.  I also include the old time cask club, the SMWS here:
