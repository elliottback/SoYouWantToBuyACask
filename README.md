# SoYouWantToBuyACask
So, you want to buy a whisky cask?  Here's a collection of resources.

# First Things First

# Crowdfunding / Shared Cask Options

Buying and warehousing an entire cask is not necessarily an easy undertaking, and every cask has its share of risk of being a dud.  Logistically, it might make more sense to buy individual bottle shares in casks of interest; several companies have begun to do this.  I also include the old time cask club, the SMWS here:

* [Craft Whisky Club's Caskshare](https://www.craftwhiskyclub.com/en/caskshare/casks)
* [The Scotch Malt Whisky Society](https://www.smws.com/) also [in Japan](https://smwsjapan.com)

# Investment / Brokers

There are lots of brokers who will help you buy a cask ... for a price!

# The Graveyard

Casks that once were for sale, but not at time of writing anymore.  As it's an evolving business and market, it's quite possible that these might once again sell casks to the public.
