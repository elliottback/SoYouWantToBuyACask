# So, You Want To Buy A Cask?
So, you want to buy a whisky cask?  Here's a collection of resources.

Please note that I have listed prices, when available, **inclusive of warehousing costs** for the listed period, but **exclusive of bottling/distribution/taxes**.  

# First Things First

* [Should you buy or invest in a whisky cask?](https://www.whiskyandwisdom.com/should-you-buy-or-invest-in-a-cask-of-whisky/)
* [A Sample Agreement from Arran](https://www.arranwhisky.com/assets/000/000/456/Arran_Cask_Purchase_2019_original.pdf?1547202686) - exactly what you're getting into 
* [Cask Bottling Cost Calculator](https://www.marklittler.com/cask-calculator/) - expect to spend $10,000 or so if you actually bottle it

Before you go buy casks, think about what you would do with hundreds of bottles of unpopular scotch, which you cannot resell (distilleries claim the right of first refusal). Maybe you'll drink it all, maybe not. Also, due at bottling, are various taxes, bottling and labeling fees, etc. If you choose not to bottle after the initial time period, you will need to pay for bonded storage until you are ready.

Lastly, you are buying a single cask, and there's no guarantee if it's going to be any good. Distilleries blend together a variety of casks to create consistent product; as a single-cask consumer, you won't have that luxury.

# Crowdfunding / Shared Cask Options

Buying and warehousing an entire cask is not necessarily an easy undertaking, and every cask has its share of risk of being a dud.  Logistically, it might make more sense to buy individual bottle shares in casks of interest; several companies have begun to do this.  I also include the old time cask club, the SMWS here:

* [Craft Whisky Club's Caskshare](https://www.craftwhiskyclub.com/en/caskshare/casks)
* [casQueteers](http://www.casqueteers.com/beschikbare-cask-programmas/)
* [The Scotch Malt Whisky Society](https://www.smws.com/) also [in Japan](https://smwsjapan.com)
