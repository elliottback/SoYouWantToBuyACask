## Crowdfunding / Shared Cask Options

Buying and warehousing an entire cask is not necessarily an easy undertaking, and every cask has its share of risk of being a dud.  Logistically, it might make more sense to buy individual bottle shares in casks of interest; several companies have begun to do this.  I also include the old time cask club, the SMWS here:

* [Craft Whisky Club's Caskshare](https://www.caskshare.com/caskshares)
* [Still In Cask](https://stillincask.com/selections/all)
* [casQueteers](http://www.casqueteers.com/beschikbare-cask-programmas/)
* [The Scotch Malt Whisky Society](https://www.smws.com/) also [in Japan](https://smwsjapan.com) and [America](https://www.smwsa.com/)
