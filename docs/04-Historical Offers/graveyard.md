## The Graveyard

Casks that once were for sale, but not at time of writing anymore.  As it's an evolving business and market, it's quite possible that these might once again sell casks to the public.

### Ongoing Concerns

Companies that appear to exist still:

* [Abbey Whisky Cask Ownership](https://www.abbeywhisky.com/cask-ownership.html)
* [Barra](http://www.uisgebeathananeilean.co.uk/invest.html)
* [Bruichladdich](https://www.bruichladdich.com/whisky-shop/casks)
* [Glengoyne](https://shop.glengoyne.com/)
* [Glasgow](https://www.glasgowdistillery.com/)
* [Highland Park Viking Soul Cask](https://www.highlandparkwhisky.com/viking-soul-cask-release/)
* [Lagg](http://www.laggwhisky.com/)
* [Lidl](https://www.lidl.de/de/ben-bracken-whiskyfass-30l/p302982)
* [Pinckney Bend](http://pinckneybend.com/buy-your-own-barrel/)

### Troubled Waters

Companies that appear to be struggling:

* [Nephin Whisky](https://www.instagram.com/nephinwhiskey/) - "the beleaguered Mayo distillery, is working on a fresh round of investment to complete its facility after the resolution of a bitter boardroom battle"

### Six Feet Under

* Urban Distilleries [original](https://www.urbandistilleries.ca/) & [current](https://www.urban-distilleries.com/home/).  The original now reads "QWT stole Urban Disteries from XYZ and took it to enrich QWT and gave him nothing! To boot, I even stole his shareholders loan.  XYZ dedicated 10 years of his life to create a unique craft distillery in Kelowna only to have his company, customers, vendors, recipes and products stolen by QWT.  I hope you do not support this business in any way!"
