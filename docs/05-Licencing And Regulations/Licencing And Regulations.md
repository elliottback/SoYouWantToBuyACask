## Licensing & Regulations

This information is presented to the best of my knowledge; I am not a lawyer, nor is this tax or legal advice.

### United Kingdom

Scotch whisky must be matured in a UK tax-authority (HMRC) bonded warehouse, where the cask is stored duty and VAT free.  Both the warehouse and the cask owners are required to have a WOWGR licence (Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations) to hold and transfer cask-whisky in bond.  A [revenue trader](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/section/1), such as an independent bottler, or a cask-middleman, is also required to hold a WOWGR license.

A strict reading of this tax code can be read to mean that private cask speculators should also hold a WOWGR license.

This is intended to change in 2023 via the complete repeal of [all WOWGR regulations](https://www.britishdistillersalliance.com/bulletins).

### Japan

The authority which controls alcohol licensing is the National Tax Agency (NTA).  Unless you are dealing in whisky as a business (for example, a spirits business, selling to consumers, etc) there isn't any licensing needed for private/personal cask investment.
