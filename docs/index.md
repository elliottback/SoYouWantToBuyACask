So, you want to buy a whisky cask?  Here's a collection of resources.

Please note that I have listed prices, when available, **inclusive of warehousing costs** for the listed period, but **exclusive of bottling/distribution/taxes**.  

## Notice from the Scotch Whisky Association

Please read [SWA's newly published guidance on personal investment in Scotch Whisky casks](https://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/media/1738/personal-investment-in-a-scotch-whisky-cask_2023.pdf) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230628235300/https://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/media/1738/personal-investment-in-a-scotch-whisky-cask_2023.pdf)):

> [T]here is no regulated market for mature or maturing casks of Scotch Whisky, no officially published list of buying and selling prices for casks from different distilleries or at different ages and no established mechanism for selling. Scotch Whisky casks are not a regularly traded commodity on an open market.
> 
> Therefore any investment in a cask made by an individual with a view to selling it on at a profit must be made on the basis of their personal assessment of the risk and the value of the investment to them.

## First Things First

You should definitely read-through these links to get some idea about purchasing cask whisky:

Before you go buy casks, think about what you would do with hundreds of bottles of unpopular scotch, which you cannot resell (distilleries claim the right of first refusal). Maybe you'll drink it all, maybe not. Also, due at bottling, are various taxes, bottling and labeling fees, etc. If you choose not to bottle after the initial time period, you will need to pay for bonded storage until you are ready.

Lastly, you are buying a single cask, and there's no guarantee if it's going to be any good. Distilleries blend together a variety of casks to create consistent product; as a single-cask consumer, you won't have that luxury.
