# So, You Want To Buy A Cask?

So, you want to buy a whisky cask?  Here's a collection of resources.

Please note that I have listed prices, when available, **inclusive of warehousing costs** for the listed period, but **exclusive of bottling/distribution/taxes**.  

## First Things First

You should definitely read-through these links to get some idea about purchasing cask whisky:

Before you go buy casks, think about what you would do with hundreds of bottles of unpopular scotch, which you cannot resell (distilleries claim the right of first refusal). Maybe you'll drink it all, maybe not. Also, due at bottling, are various taxes, bottling and labeling fees, etc. If you choose not to bottle after the initial time period, you will need to pay for bonded storage until you are ready.

Lastly, you are buying a single cask, and there's no guarantee if it's going to be any good. Distilleries blend together a variety of casks to create consistent product; as a single-cask consumer, you won't have that luxury.

## Licensing & Regulations

This information is presented to the best of my knowledge; I am not a lawyer, nor is this tax or legal advice.

### United Kingdom

Scotch whisky must be matured in a UK tax-authority (HMRC) bonded warehouse, where the cask is stored duty and VAT free.  Both the warehouse and the cask owners are required to have a WOWGR licence (Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations) to hold and transfer cask-whisky in bond.  A [revenue trader](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2/section/1), such as an independent bottler, or a cask-middleman, is also required to hold a WOWGR license.  

A strict reading of this tax code can be read to mean that private cask speculators should also hold a WOWGR license.

This is intended to change in 2023 via the complete repeal of [all WOWGR regulations](https://www.britishdistillersalliance.com/bulletins).

### Japan

The authority which controls alcohol licensing is the National Tax Agency (NTA).  Unless you are dealing in whisky as a business (for example, a spirits business, selling to consumers, etc) there isn't any licensing needed for private/personal cask investment.
